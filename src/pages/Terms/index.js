        <br /> The organiser may, at its discretion, refuse an individual entry
        to the competition or to award any prize if such individual fails to
        comply with these terms or the applicable laws or if such individual’s
        involvement with the competition may cause adverse publicity to the
        organiser.

        Your Entry must not include inappropriate language, gratuitous violence,
        sexual references or statements that, in the Organiser’s opinion,
        promote hatred towards an individual, race, or community.
        <br />
        <br />
        You promise and warrant that:
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>a)</strong> all details provided with your Entry are true
            and accurate;
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>b)</strong> your Entry is wholly comprised of original work,
            created and owned by you, not previously communicated to the public;
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>c)</strong> your Entry does not contain commercial words,

            product or product logo other than your school’s crest;

          <li>
            <strong>e)</strong> you have all necessary rights and licenses to

          <li>
            <strong>f)</strong> the exercise of the rights granted to the

        The decision of the judging panel (acting reasonably) will be final and
        binding. During judging, chance plays no part in determining the
        Winners; and the judging panel may choose more than one Winner/runner up
        at their sole discretion.
        <br /> You will receive the relevant prize (‘Prize’). The Prize value is
        correct at time of printing but no responsibility is accepted for any
        variation in the value of any Prize. In the event that any prize is
        unavailable for whatever reason, the Organiser reserves the right to
        substitute any prize for a prize of equal or greater value. <br />
        <br />
        If you have not been in contact with the Organiser to claim your Prize
        within 5 days of a notification telephone call or email, the Organiser
        reserves the right to offer the Prize to the next eligible entrant. The
        Organiser does not accept any responsibility if you are not able (or
        otherwise fail) to take up the Prize.
        <br /> Prizes are not transferable or exchangeable, and non-monetary
        components cannot be taken as a monetary payment. Any costs incurred
        that are incidental to the fulfilment of the Prize are your sole
        responsibility. To the full extent permitted by law (which does not
        affect your statutory rights), the Organiser, its agents or distributors
        will not in any circumstances be responsible or liable to compensate you
        or accept any liability for:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>a)</strong> any incorrect or inaccurate information;
          </li>

            <strong>b)</strong> any technical error that may occur in the course
            of the administration of this Competition;
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>c)</strong> any error, omission, interruption, deletion,
            defect, loss or delay of any Entry or otherwise in operation or
            transmission, communications line failure, technical malfunction,
            theft or destruction or unauthorised access to or alteration of your
            Entry or the running of the Competition; or
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>d)</strong> any injury, damages, expenses, or loss
            whatsoever (whether direct or consequential) to you or your property
            as a result of any person entering into the Competition or accepting
            or using any Prize, including without limitation non-receipt or
            damage to any Prize except where it is caused by the negligence of
            the Organiser, its agents or distributors or that of their employees
          </li>
        </ul>
